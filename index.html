<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<h3>
<a id="git" class="anchor" href="#git" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Git allows you to do very small projects to even bigger projects on your local computer with effeciency and speed. Allowing you to easely get done any type of project and use its database programming.</li>
<li>Git is LOCAL, which means this can be used locally without the use of Github, Git can be used on its own platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="github" class="anchor" href="#github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Github:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Github allows you to take these changes that you have made and place them all over the web so people can see and work on your projects. This allows you to easely collaborate with your friends and share eachothers work in order to get progress done.</li>
<li>Github would be considered web based and allowing sharing using the forking repositories and cloning, as well as git commit and many others you could do with git hub (The Remote)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Basically, Git is the local PC database and Github would be the web based database where you would be able to share your work with others</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This basically ensures that your name is attached to your repositiories and everythiong else. It's good to print your name in and everything else. </p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>user.email</p>

<ul>

<p><code>You can be able to do this with planting git config user.email and your email after that, for example; johndoe556@gmail.com</code></p>
